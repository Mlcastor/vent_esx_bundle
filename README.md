## ‚ú® Mission
This repository keeps the legendary collection of ESX resources alive while modernising the codebase, adopting industry best-practices and welcoming community collaboration.  
Our goal is to deliver **production-ready, performant and fully-documented scripts** for FiveM servers, all while paying full respect to the original work of HumanTree92.

## üìå Why Another Fork?
1. **Preservation.** Ensure a proven codebase does not vanish after archive status.
2. **Modernisation.** Apply clean-code principles, strong typing, CI/CD and automated testing to legacy scripts.
3. **Performance & Security.** Profiling, zero-allocation hot-paths and exploit-resistant patterns.
4. **Community Growth.** Provide docs, issue templates and mentorship to newcomers.

## üó∫Ô∏è Strategic Roadmap (10 Days)
| Phase | Timeframe | Focus | Key Deliverable |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **1** | Day 1-2 | Resource Template & Tooling | Standardised template repo w/ Stylua, Luacheck, CI |
| **2** | Day 3-4 | Independent Repo Migration | Each script migrated to separate repo preserving history |
| **3** | Day 5-6 | Per-Resource CI/CD & Versioning | Semantic release pipeline per repo |
| **4** | Day 7-8 | Bundle Repo & Release Pipeline | Submodule integration + automated bundle zip |
| **5** | Day 9-10 | Docs & Community Launch | Docs site, install script, onboarding |

### **Phase 0 ‚Äì Project Bootstrap** (Day 0)
- Create **meta distribution repo** `vent_esx_bundle`.
- Add root GPL copy, Code of Conduct, central README (this file).
- Configure issue templates & discussion board.

### **Phase 1 ‚Äì Resource Template & Tooling** (Day 1-2)
- Build **GitHub repo template** containing:
  - `fxmanifest.lua` skeleton.
  - Stylua & Luacheck configs.
  - Reusable GitHub Action (`ci.yml`) running lint + tests.
- Publish the template and write `init-resource.sh` scaffold script.

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì Independent Repo Migration** (Day 3-4)
- Import each legacy script with `git filter-repo` (keeps history).
- Apply template, fix lint errors, add basic tests.
- Tag first semantic version (`v1.0.0`).

### **Phase 3 ‚Äì Per-Resource CI/CD & Versioning** (Day 5-6)
- Integrate **Conventional Commits** + `release-please` for auto-changelogs.
- Add headless FXServer test harness for smoke tests.
- Publish releases with zipped assets & checksum.

### **Phase 4 ‚Äì Bundle Repo & Release Pipeline** (Day 7-8)
- Add **git submodules** (or subtrees) pointing to each script at the latest tag.
- Introduce `bundle.yml` manifest and `assemble-bundle.sh`.
- GitHub Action builds nightly & on tag, uploads `VENT_ESX_Bundle_<date>.zip`.

### **Phase 5 ‚Äì Documentation & Community Launch** (Day 9-10)
- Generate docs site with **Docusaurus** from bundle repo.
- Write install guide, migration docs, contribution handbook.
- Announce 1.0 launch on Cfx.re forums, Discord & Twitter.

## üöÄ Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Clone the repo (or use Git submodules in your resources folder)
git clone https://github.com/Mlcastor/VENT_ESX_Scripts.git vent_esx_scripts

# 2. Add resources to your server.cfg (order matters!)
ensure es_extended  # or your ESX fork
ensure oxmysql      # database driver
ensure vent_esx_scripts/esx_advancedbanking
# ...add the rest as you need

# 3. Optional alignment (menu position)
setr esx_MenuAlign "top-right"   # top-left | top-right | bottom-left | bottom-right
```

### Requirements
- **FXServer** latest artifact  
- **ESX Legacy ‚â• 1.6** (or compatible fork)  
- **oxmysql** @ `^1.8.0`  
- Basic understanding of resource installation & configuration
